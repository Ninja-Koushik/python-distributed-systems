Here's a refactored and production-ready version of the `Master.py` script. The improvements focus on enhancing fault tolerance, readability, and testability, which are crucial for a robust distributed system.

The key changes include:

1.  **Thread-Safe Job Re-queuing**: The logic to handle dead workers and re-queue their jobs has been refined for better concurrency control.
2.  **Robust Persistence**: The job saving and loading logic now correctly handles various states of jobs (in the queue and in progress).
3.  **Comprehensive Docstrings and Type Hinting**: All methods and classes now have detailed docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, and behavior. Type hints are used throughout to improve code clarity and enable static analysis.
4.  **Graceful Shutdown**: The script now includes a mechanism to shut down the server gracefully, which is a critical feature for production environments.

Master.py

Description:
This script serves as the master node in a distributed job queue system. It uses gRPC
to manage a centralized job queue, dispatching tasks to available worker nodes and
collecting their results. Key features include:
- A gRPC server to handle requests from clients (submitting jobs) and workers
  (fetching jobs, sending results, and heartbeats).
- Job persistence to a JSON file, ensuring that the job queue state is not lost
  on master node restarts.
- Worker health checks via heartbeats, which enables the master to detect
  failed workers and re-queue their assigned jobs for another worker to process.
